## PROBLEM STATEMENT : 

# Travelling salesman problem
he Travelling Salesman Problem describes a salesman who must travel between N cities.
The order in which he does so is something he does not care about, as long as he visits each once during his trip,
and finishes where he was at first.

# SOLUTION: 

Using Genetic algorithm we try to find best possible route by evolving it's population. Initial population is set of valid solutions.

# OUTPUT:

Iteration 0: distance: 314.578131
Best found route=  [8 3 9 1 5 2 0 6 7 4 8]

Iteration 3: distance: 287.762242
Best found route=  [3 7 6 1 5 4 2 8 9 0 3]

Iteration 10: distance: 241.537717
Best found route=  [8 6 2 7 3 0 9 5 1 4 8]

Iteration 12: distance: 240.675825
Best found route=  [1 6 2 7 3 0 9 5 4 8 1]

Iteration 19: distance: 205.211592
Best found route=  [7 3 0 9 2 5 1 6 8 4 7]

Iteration 199: distance: 204.035372
Best found route=  [7 3 0 9 2 4 8 6 1 5 7]

Iteration 496: distance: 187.267994
Best found route=  [5 1 6 8 4 2 7 3 0 9 5]
